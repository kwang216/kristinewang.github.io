      <description>Data Wrangling and Data Exploration  Packages: library(datasets) # install.packages(&amp;#39;tidyverse&amp;#39;) library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(cluster) Introduction This dataset is about the types of arrests in the US and specific descriptives about each state. The “US Arrests” dataset contiains the variables: State, Murder, Assault, Urban pop, and Rape. The “state.x77” dataset contains the variables: State, Population, Income, Life Exp, Murder, HS Grad, Frost, and Area. These datasets were found in library(datasets). I used these data sets to see the difference between states with variables that aren’t common and due to the raising assault incidences I became interested in this topic.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the ‘meterorites’ dataset, which is a dataset containing information about meteorites and where they fell. This dataset was obtained from the meteoritical soceity by NASA. It contains the variables: name, id, name_type, class, mass, fall year, lat, long, and geolocation of the meteorites.
